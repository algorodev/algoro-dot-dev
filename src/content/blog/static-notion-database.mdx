When building my personal portfolio, I wanted it to be fast, minimal, and easy to maintain. Instead of relying on a heavy CMS, I decided to use **Notion as a lightweight database** for all my static content — from blog posts to project descriptions and about-me sections.
Here’s why and how I did it:
### **Why Notion?**
Notion gives me:
- **A clean content editor** – I can focus on writing without dealing with code.
- **An API** – Perfect for fetching data dynamically into my portfolio.
- **Centralized content management** – Everything is in one place: posts, pages, metadata, and more.
This way, I don’t have to redeploy my website every time I want to add a blog post or update a description.

### **Static Content for a Fast Website**
My portfolio is built with **Astro + Tailwind**. I fetch the content from Notion during build time, so the blog posts are transformed into static HTML pages.
The benefit?
- **No database queries on every visit.**
- **Fast load times** because everything is pre-rendered.
- **SEO-friendly** static pages.
It’s the best of both worlds: dynamic content creation with a static website’s performance.

### **How I Structure My Content in Notion**
I keep a single Notion database with:
- **Title**: Post title
- **Slug**: Used for the URL
- **Date**: Publishing date
- **Tags**: For filtering on the blog page
- **Content**: The body of the post
From there, my portfolio fetches the database, maps each entry, and generates the blog pages automatically.

### **Writing Posts Becomes Effortless**
Now, whenever I want to create a new blog post:
1. I open my Notion page.
1. Write the post.
1. Publish it by simply toggling a property in Notion.
Next time my site rebuilds, the post is live — no coding needed.
---
### **Results**
- **Content management feels natural** because Notion is easy to use.
- **My blog page stays fast** with static rendering.
- **I focus on writing** instead of fiddling with markdown files or CMS setups.
This approach has been a game-changer for keeping my portfolio simple yet dynamic.
