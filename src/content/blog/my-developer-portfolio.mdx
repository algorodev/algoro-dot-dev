Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on my personal portfolio — a place where I can showcase my projects, share my story, and create a central hub for everything I’m building as a software engineer.
I didn’t want just another static website with my name on it. My goal was to create a **living portfolio** that evolves with my career: projects, blog posts, and new learnings, all in one place.
Here’s how I approached it, what I learned along the way, and some advice if you want to build yours too.
---
### **Start with the “Why”**
Before touching any code, I took a step back and asked myself:
- What do I want people to see first when they land on my page?
- What kind of projects represent me best?
- How can I keep this easy to maintain and update?
For me, the goal was simple: **show my work, my skills, and my personality** — all in a clean, professional way.
---
### **Choosing the Tech Stack**
I decided to go with **Astro + TailwindCSS** for the frontend.
- **Astro** keeps things lightweight and fast.
- **TailwindCSS** makes styling consistent and easy to maintain.
- For content, I used **Notion as my CMS**, so I can write posts (like this one) directly from Notion, without editing code every time.
Tip: Don’t overcomplicate things. Use a stack you’re comfortable with, and focus on **clarity, performance, and maintainability**.

### **Content First, Design Second**
The most important thing in a portfolio isn’t fancy animations or complex UI — it’s **what you show**:
- **About Me** → A short section about who you are and what drives you.
- **Projects** → Real, impactful work with descriptions, tech used, and links.
- **Blog or Insights** → Sharing what you learn builds credibility.
Once the content was clear, I kept the design **minimal and clean** — whitespace, simple typography, and consistent colors go a long way.

### Add a Personal Touch
Your portfolio should feel like **you**.
I included side projects, some experiments I’ve built, and a short story of my career journey. Recruiters or collaborators love to see **the human side** behind the code.
---
### **Launch, Then Improve**
I’ve learned that waiting for perfection is the enemy of progress.
The first version of my portfolio was simple. Over time, I’ll keep iterating: improving the design, adding projects, and writing more posts like this one.
So my advice: **launch it as soon as it’s functional**. You can always improve it later.

### **Final Thoughts**
Building my portfolio was a fun project that helped me reflect on my work, organize my projects, and create a home for everything I’m building.
If you’re thinking about building your own:
- Keep it simple.
- Focus on content first.
- Let it reflect who you are as a developer (and as a person).
Your portfolio is never “done” — it evolves as you do.
