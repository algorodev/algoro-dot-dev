I’m Alejandro, aka **algorodev**, a software engineer focused on building fast, accessible, and reliable web products. Over the past 6+ years I’ve specialized in modern frontend engineering (Javascript, Typescript, Nuxt, Next, TailwindCSS) with a strong grasp of the full stack (Node, Django, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, Kubernetes). I care about clean architecture, measurable outcomes, and code that’s easy to change.
<div class="my-2" />
My day-to-day spans designing and shipping features, hardening error handling, and raising the engineering bar: centralized logging (Pino → Kibana), structured analytics (GTM/dataLayer), performance and a11y budgets, automated testing (Vitest, Playwright), Storybook-driven UI, and rock-solid CI. I’ve also integrated 3rd-party services (e.g., AskDialog SDK, Twilio chat), led DevChapter/SkillPill sessions on topics like store management and Tailwind, and pushed for good documentation habits (ADRs, clear READMEs).
<div class="my-2" />
I bring a **product mindset**: discover the real user problem, prototype quickly, instrument everything, iterate with data. I enjoy the craft—SOLID principles, thoughtful abstractions, purposeful naming—and I believe tests are there to enable speed, not slow it down. I like systems with observability, predictable errors, and graceful fallbacks (error boundaries, retries, timeouts, typed errors).

Originally from **Valencia (Spain)**, now based in **Dublin**, I balance work with the gym, long walks, and travel. In 2025 I’m leveling up my cloud literacy and deepening my expertise in performance, observability, and AI-assisted product development.

If you’re building something that should feel fast, accessible, and maintainable—or you want to jam on developer experience and product delivery—let’s talk.
